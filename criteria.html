			<h2>Explanations</h2>
			<p><a name="stirling" class="jump"></a><u>Lindsey Stirling:</u> She fits the mission because she's well renowned for her unique violin and dance style which also makes her very artistic. She's played at the Flynn before to a sold-out show, but is a higher-end act. Due to having the ability to sell out a MainStage show, I believe she fits the demographic pretty well.</p>
			<br>
			<p><a name="bei_bei" class="jump"></a><u>Bei Bei He (荷蓓蓓):</u> She's an up and coming artist, who usually does concerts that are free to the public. However she does have a paid concert scheduled for next Februrary. These factors both impact our mission and budget. She's decently artistic. Her social medias have very little traction, videos averaging at about 50k (one outlier at 1.3M from 5 years ago) with a subcount of 10k and only 2.6k Facebook followers. I'm unsure of how she'd rank in regards to the local demographic, but considering she's a newcomer more likely less than more.</p>
			<br>
			<p><a name="shankar" class="jump"></a><u>Anoushka Shankar:</u> She's widely renowed as a masterful sitar player, which affects the mission and artistic qualities. She plays larger halls upwards of 3000, affecting the budget. Even though she's widely popular, I'm unsure how she would fit in the Burlington demographic.</p>
			<br>
			<p><a name="kazue" class="jump"></a><u>Sawai Kazue (沢井 一恵):</u> She's well-known in Japan for the koto school ran by herself and her late husband, she's less known in the states, which affects the mission. She's played in smaller halls of under 100. These both affect the budget significantly. She's a pretty unique artist, so I'm unsure how her classical koto style would fit in with the burlington demographic.</p>
			<br>
			<p><a name="macmaster" class="jump"></a><u>Natalie MacMaster:</u> She fits the well-renowned portion of the mission, and adds a different flavor to the series through her fiddle music. Adequate impact on the budget, but a closer artist to book. Has also played at the Flynn on the MainStage multiple times, which impacts the budget and demographic.</p>
			<br>
			<p><a name="henson_conant" class="jump"></a><u>Deborah Henson-Conant:</u> She's a smaller artist who plays in halls of about 300 and is not necessarily widely known even though she's toured internationally, which fits the up-and-coming portion of the mission. She certainly has a unique and flamboyant style, which helps her artistically. Being less known affects the budget. I'm unsure of how much of a demographic fit she'd be, but I'd hazard a guess at less likely rather than more.</p>
			<br>
			<p><a name="wu_man" class="jump"></a><u>Wu Man (吴蛮):</u> She fits the mission because she's very well renowned as a masterful pipa player. She's virtuosic which leads to being very artistic. With mastery also comes a heftier impact on the budget. She's played in Burlington through the Lane Series, which helps the demographic in the sense that she'd be a returning performer.</p>
			<br>
			<p><a name="yo_yo" class="jump"></a><u>Yo-Yo Ma:</u> He boasts a variety of styles, a large repetoire, and plenty of clout in the industry. This drastically affect his artistic qualities and the budget. He's gone beyond the point of being a well-renowned artist which fits in with the mission. He's played at the Flynn before, which helps the demographic.</p>
