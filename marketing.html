			<h1>Marketing</h1>
			<p class="indent">This series follows the single ticket model. There's different prices for students, children, and adults. This aims to assist the mission statement in making the series fully accessible to all ages, and hopefully encourage parents to bring children along and expose them to things they might not encounter in their day-to-day life.</p>
			<p class="indent">We plan to have a very web-based form of advertising, hitting Facebook, Twitter, and other social outlets. We plan to have a company Instagram account with access to behind the scenes coverage.</p>
			<p class="indent">Another thought we had was to record all our performances and have them open to the public. That way, if you decided that the tickets for a given performance were too expensive, you'd have full access to it a month or so after it occurred. This fits our mission in making shows accessible to everyone of all ages. However, this is a little counterintuitive when it comes to a business model. We would need to ensure that performances are unique, that way past recordings don't discount any upcoming repeat performers.</p>
