			<h2>Administrative Staff</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Producing Director
					<ol>
						<li>They work to set the vision and the mission for the company and seires. They're ultimately in charge of employees and finances, and often considered the figurehead of the organization. Should also have general knowledge of web development in order to understand and stay on the same page as the Marketing Director.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Artistic Director
					<ol>
						<li>They choose and contract the artists necessary for the season and individual shows. They pursue the fees necessary for the given artists, and have a general grasp on how to pull in customers or patrons. They should also have general knowledge of web development and artistic design in order to assist the Producing Director on brand choices concerning media outlets.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Marketing Director
					<ol>
						<li>They manage all media outlets necessary for the organization. Additionally, they focus on improving and expanding our image and brand. They should have moderate artistic talent and knowledge in order to present high quality media to the public.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Stage Manager
					<ol>
						<li>They're present at all times during performances just in case anything goes wrong. They should have a "show must go on" attitude and be prepared to think quickly on their feet. If necessary they can defer to the Producing Director's judgement.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Logistics Manager
					<ol>
						<li>They handle lodging and hospitality for the artists. They book hotels, flights, rentals, and other things that are either quality of life or of the utmost importance. Additionally they hold a sort of jack-of-all-trades position, assisting the other staff members in anything they might need input or feedback on.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					Additionally: Since this is a smaller organization utilizing a rented venue, many of the duties detailed above overlap. In the ideal situation, every staff member should be able to pick up the work and slack of another department. Since the entire staff is made up of directors and managers, everyone is just about on equal footing except for the Producing Director.
